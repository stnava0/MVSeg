  abstract = {Simulations provide a way of generating data where ground truth is
	known, enabling quantitative testing of image processing methods.
	In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital
	brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data.
	The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account
	intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom
	was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton
	density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from
	each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to
	classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into
	grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically
	generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain
	structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter,
	white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone,
	dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy
	vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic
	resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes
	that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define
	the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the
	fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used
	to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET,
	or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted
	MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose
	two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same
	acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing
	the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated
	data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison
	between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first
	comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent
	the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated
	and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison
	enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class.
	The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when
	real data are corrected for intensity nonuniformity.},

	analysis of cortical and white matter atrophy rates with penalized
	statistical methods. The pipeline uses a step-wise approach to transform
	and personalize template information first to a single-subject template
	(SST) and then to the individual's time series data. The first stream
	of information flows from group template to the SST; the second flows
	from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased,
	prior-based segmentation and measurement of cortical thickness. MRI-bias
	correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation
	and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of
	the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping
	between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach
	with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological
	problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces
	(a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content
	as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance
	estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data
	is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when

	support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

	enables the method to easily adapt to various kinds of MR images

	for the intensity nonuniformity and performs reasonably well on T1-weighted
	MR data without nonuniformity correction. The method minimizes an
	information-theoretic metric on the probability density functions
	associated with image neighborhoods to produce an optimal classification.
	It automatically tunes its important internal parameters based on
	the information content of the data. Combined with an atlas-based
	initialization, it is completely automatic. Experiments on real,

	tensor (DT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation
	schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means (FCM), incorporate Gaussian
	class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters
	characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors
	in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in
	Riemannian spaces. Unlike FCM-based schemes, the proposed method
	represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical
	models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique
	for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian DT spaces. The proposed
	method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel
	information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework.
	Results on synthetic and real, DT and MR images, show that the proposed
	method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation
	decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial
	voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model
	to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle,
	we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical
	tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds
	on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking,
	can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise.
	For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts
	with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results
	demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly
	more accurately as compared to tractography.},

	Occasionally, however, BET produces imperfect results (e.g., inclusion
	of non-brain structures). This is usually either ignored (if inaccuracies
	are small) or corrected by manual adjustment, with the disadvantages
	of user intervention. We describe here a new, automated option in
	BET. This is based on the original BET, but uses standard-space masking
	to remove tissue around the eyes, and further morphological operations
	and thresholding to refine eyeball removal and eliminate additional
	non-brain tissues. To assess whether the new BET procedure improves
	brain volume measurements, this was compared with the traditional
	and manual editing procedures in SIENA and SIENAX. Measures of atrophy
	rate and state were significantly higher with the traditional procedure
	than with the manual editing and new procedures. In contrast, both
	atrophy measures were almost identical and highly correlated when

  abstract = {This paper has reviewed, with somewhat variable coverage, the nine
	MR image segmentation techniques itemized in Table II. A wide array
	of approaches have been discussed; each has its merits and drawbacks.
	We have also given pointers to other approaches not discussed in
	depth in this review. The methods reviewed fall roughly into four
	model groups: c-means, maximum likelihood, neural networks, and k-nearest
	neighbor rules. Both supervised and unsupervised schemes require
	human intervention to obtain clinically useful results in MR segmentation.
	Unsupervised techniques require somewhat less interaction on a per
	patient/image basis. Maximum likelihood techniques have had some
	success, but are very susceptible to the choice of training region,
	which may need to be chosen slice by slice for even one patient.
	Generally, techniques that must assume an underlying statistical
	distribution of the data (such as LML and UML) do not appear promising,
	since tissue regions of interest do not usually obey the distributional
	tendencies of probability density functions. The most promising supervised
	techniques reviewed seem to be FF/NN methods that allow hidden layers
	to be configured as examples are presented to the system. An example
	of a self-configuring network, FF/CC, was also discussed. The relatively
	simple k-nearest neighbor rule algorithms (hard and fuzzy) have also
	shown promise in the supervised category. Unsupervised techniques
	based upon fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms have also shown great
	promise in MR image segmentation. Several unsupervised connectionist
	techniques have recently been experimented with on MR images of the
	brain and have provided promising initial results. A pixel-intensity-based
	edge detection algorithm has recently been used to provide promising
	segmentations of the brain. This is also an unsupervised technique,
	older versions of which have been susceptible to oversegmenting the
	image because of the lack of clear boundaries between tissue types
	or finding uninteresting boundaries between slightly different types
	of the same tissue. To conclude, we offer some remarks about improving
	MR segmentation techniques. The better unsupervised techniques are
	too slow. Improving speed via parallelization and optimization will
	improve their competitiveness with, e.g., the k-nn rule, which is
	the fastest technique covered in this review. Another area for development
	is dynamic cluster validity. Unsupervised methods need better ways
	to specify and adjust c, the number of tissue classes found by the
	algorithm. Initialization is a third important area of research.
	Many of the schemes listed in Table II are sensitive to good initialization,
	both in terms of the parameters of the design, as well as operator
	selection of training data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	FAST, SPM5, an automatically trained k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier,
	and a conventional kNN classifier based on a prior training set.
	The intensity nonuniformity correction and skull-stripping mask were
	the same for all methods. Evaluations were performed on MRI scans
	of elderly subjects derived from the general population. Accuracy
	was evaluated by comparison to two manual segmentations of MRI scans
	of six subjects (mean age 65.9+/-4.4 years). Reproducibility was
	assessed by comparing the automatic segmentations of 30 subjects
	(mean age 57.0+/-3.7 years) who were scanned twice within a short
	time interval. All methods showed good accuracy and reproducibility,
	with only small differences between methods. The conventional kNN
	classifier was the most accurate method with similarity indices of
	0.82/0.90/0.94 for cerebrospinal fluid/gray matter/white matter,
	but it showed the lowest reproducibility. FAST yielded the most reproducible
	segmentation volumes with volume difference standard deviations of
	0.55/0.49/0.38 (percentage of intracranial volume) respectively.
	The results of the reproducibility experiment can be used to calculate
	the required number of subjects in the design of a longitudinal study
	with sufficient power to detect changes over time in brain (tissue)
	volume. Example sample size calculations demonstrate a rather large
	effect of the choice of segmentation method on the required number

	are increasingly important but can be degraded by intensity non-uniformity.
	This non-uniformity can be more pronounced at higher field strengths,
	or when using multichannel receiver coils. We assessed the ability
	of the non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) technique
	to correct non-uniformity in 72 volumetric brain MR scans from the
	preparatory phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	(ADNI). Normal elderly subjects (n=18) were scanned on different
	3-T scanners with a multichannel phased array receiver coil at baseline,
	using magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) and spoiled
	gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequences, and again 2 weeks later. When
	applying N3, we used five brain masks of varying accuracy and four
	spline smoothing distances (d=50, 100, 150 and 200 mm) to ascertain
	which combination of parameters optimally reduces the non-uniformity.
	We used the normalized white matter intensity variance (standard
	deviation/mean) to ascertain quantitatively the correction for a
	single scan; we used the variance of the normalized difference image
	to assess quantitatively the consistency of the correction over time
	from registered scan pairs. Our results showed statistically significant
	(p<0.01) improvement in uniformity for individual scans and reduction
	in the normalized difference image variance when using masks that
	identified distinct brain tissue classes, and when using smaller
	spline smoothing distances (e.g., 50-100 mm) for both MP-RAGE and
	SPGR pulse sequences. These optimized settings may assist future
	large-scale studies where 3-T scanners and phased array receiver
	coils are used, such as ADNI, so that intensity non-uniformity does
	not influence the power of MR imaging to detect disease progression
	and the factors that influence it.},

	means differing by 8.7 control group standard deviations (SD's).
	A measure based on the same segmentation used by the BSI yielded

	activation paradigms are being used in conjunction with PET measures
	of cerebral activity (e.g., rCBF). The changes in local cerebral
	activity have two components: a global, region independent change
	and a local or regional change. As the first step in localizing the
	regional effects of an activation, global variance must be removed
	by a normalization procedure. A simple normalization procedure is
	division of regional values by the whole brain mean. This requires
	the dependence of local activity on global activity to be one of
	simple proportionality. This is shown not to be the case. Furthermore,
	a systematic deviation from a proportional relationship across brain
	regions is demonstrated. Consequently, any normalization must be
	approached on a pixel-by-pixel basis by measuring the change in local
	activity and change in global activity. The changes associated with
	an activation can be partitioned into global and local effects according
	to two models: one assumes that the increase in local activity depends
	on global values and the other assumes independence. It is shown
	that the increase in activity due to a cognitive activation is independent
	of global activity. This independence of the (activation) condition
	effect and the confounding linear effect of global activity on observed
	local activity meet the requirements for an analysis of covariance,
	with the "nuisance" variable as global activity and the activation
	condition as the categorical independent variable. These conclusions
	are based on analysis of data from 24 scans: six conditions over
	four normal subjects using a verbal fluency paradigm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

	random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an
	MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
	mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics

	is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution.
	The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
	maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded

  abstract = {Systematic mapping of the variability in cortical sulcal anatomy is
	an area of increasing interest which presents numerous methodological
	challenges. To address these issues, we have implemented sulcal extraction
	and assisted labeling (SEAL) to automatically extract the two-dimensional
	(2-D) surface ribbons that represent the median axis of cerebral
	sulci and to neuroanatomically label these entities. To encode the
	extracted three-dimensional (3-D) cortical sulcal schematic topography
	(CSST) we define a relational graph structure composed of two main
	features: vertices (representing sulci) and arcs (representing the
	relationships between sulci). Vertices contain a parametric representation
	of the surface ribbon buried within the sulcus. Points on this surface
	are expressed in stereotaxic coordinates (i.e., with respect to a
	standardized brain coordinate system). For each of these vertices,
	we store length, depth, and orientation as well as anatomical attributes
	(e.g., hemisphere, lobe, sulcus type, etc.). Each arc stores the
	3-D location of the junction between sulci as well as a list of its
	connecting sulci. Sulcal labeling is performed semiautomatically
	by selecting a sulcal entity in the CSST and selecting from a menu
	of candidate sulcus names. In order to help the user in the labeling
	task, the menu is restricted to the most likely candidates by using
	priors for the expected sulcal spatial distribution. These priors,
	i.e., sulcal probabilistic maps, were created from the spatial distribution
	of 34 sulci traced manually on 36 different subjects. Given these
	spatial probability maps, the user is provided with the likelihood
	that the selected entity belongs to a particular sulcus. The cortical
	structure representation obtained by SEAL is suitable to extract
	statistical information about both the spatial and the structural
	composition of the cerebral cortical topography. This methodology
	allows for the iterative construction of a successively more complete
	statistical models of the cerebral topography containing spatial
	distributions of the most important structures, their morphometrics,

  abstract = {Mindboggle (http://www.binarybottle.com/mindboggle.html) is a fully
	automated, feature matching approach to label cortical structures
	and activity anatomically in human brain MRI data. This approach
	does not assume that the existence of component structures and their
	relative spatial relationship is preserved from brain to brain, but
	instead disassembles a labeled atlas and reassembles its pieces to
	match corresponding pieces in an unlabeled subject brain before labeling.
	Mindboggle: (1) converts linearly coregistered subject and atlas
	MRI data into sulcus pieces, (2) matches each atlas piece with a
	combination of subject pieces by minimizing a cost function, (3)
	transforms atlas label boundaries to the matching subject pieces,
	(4) warps atlas labels to their transformed boundaries, and (5) propagates
	labels to fill remaining gaps in a mask derived from the subject
	brain. We compared Mindboggle with four registration methods: linear
	registration, and nonlinear registration using SPM2, AIR, and ANIMAL.
	Automated labeling by all of the nonlinear methods was found to be
	at least comparable with linear registration. Mindboggle outperformed
	every other method, as measured by the agreement between overlapping
	atlas labels and manually assigned subject labels, with respect to
	the union or the intersection of voxels. After applying the same
	procedure that Mindboggle uses to fill a subject's segmented gray
	matter mask with labels (step 5), the results of the other methods
	improved. However, after performing a one-way ANOVA (and Tukey's
	honestly significant difference criterion) in a multiple comparison
	between the results obtained by the different methods, Mindboggle
	was still found to be the only nonlinear method whose labeling performance
	was significantly better than that of linear registration or SPM2.
	Further advantages to Mindboggle include a high degree of robustness
	against image artifacts, poor image quality, and incomplete brain
	data. We tested the latter hypothesis by conducting all of the tests
	again, this time registering the atlas to an artificially lesioned
	version of itself, and found that Mindboggle was the only method
	whose performance did not degrade significantly as the lesion size
	increased.},

	enormous amount of attention lately. Of the techniques reported in

	an efficient and accurate, fully automatic 3-D segmentation procedure
	for brain MR scans. It has several salient features; namely, the
	following. 1) Instead of a single multiplicative bias field that
	affects all tissue intensities, separate parametric smooth models
	are used for the intensity of each class. 2) A brain atlas is used
	in conjunction with a robust registration procedure to find a nonrigid
	transformation that maps the standard brain to the specimen to be
	segmented. This transformation is then used to: segment the brain
	from nonbrain tissue; compute prior probabilities for each class
	at each voxel location and find an appropriate automatic initialization.
	3) Finally, a novel algorithm is presented which is a variant of
	the expectation-maximization procedure, that incorporates a fast
	and accurate way to find optimal segmentations, given the intensity
	models along with the spatial coherence assumption. Experimental
	results with both synthetic and real data are included, as well as

	exist for segmentation of GM, but none were specifically designed
	to handle issues associated with MS, such as atrophy and the effects
	that MS lesions may have on the classification of GM. A new GM segmentation
	algorithm has been developed specifically for calculation of GM volumes
	in MS patients. The new algorithm uses a combination of intensity,
	anatomical, and morphological probability maps. Several validation
	tests were performed to evaluate the algorithm in terms of accuracy,
	reproducibility, and sensitivity to MS lesions. The accuracy tests
	resulted in error rates of 1.2\% and 3.1\% for comparisons to BrainWeb
	and manual tracings, respectively. Similarity indices indicated excellent
	agreement with the BrainWeb segmentation (0.858-0.975, for various
	levels of noise and rf inhomogeneity). The scan-rescan reproducibility
	test resulted in a mean coefficient of variation of 1.1\% for GM
	fraction. Tests of the effects of varying the size of MS lesions
	revealed a moderate and consistent dependence of GM volumes on T2
	lesion volume, which suggests that GM volumes should be corrected
	for T2 lesion volumes using a simple scale factor in order to eliminate
	this technical artifact. The new segmentation algorithm can be used
	for improved measurement of GM volumes in MS patients, and is particularly

  abstract = {Segmentation of the object of interest is a difficult step in the
	analysis of digital images. Fully automatic methods sometimes fail,
	producing incorrect results and requiring the intervention of a human
	operator. This is often true in medical applications, where image
	segmentation is particularly difficult due to restrictions imposed
	by image acquisition, pathology and biological variation. In this
	paper we present an early review of the largely unknown territory
	of human-computer interaction in image segmentation. The purpose
	is to identify patterns in the use of interaction and to develop
	qualitative criteria to evaluate interactive segmentation methods.
	We discuss existing interactive methods with respect to the following
	aspects: the type of information provided by the user, how this information
	affects the computational part, and the purpose of interaction in
	the segmentation process. The discussion is based on the potential
	impact of each strategy on the accuracy, repeatability and interaction
	efficiency. Among others, these are important aspects to characterise
	and understand the implications of interaction to the results generated
	by an interactive segmentation method. This survey is focused on
	medical imaging, however similar patterns are expected to hold for
	other applications as well.},

	brains from magnetic resonance images (MRI). The analysis and study
	of newborn brain MRI is of great interest due to its potential for
	studying early growth patterns and morphological changes in neurodevelopmental
	disorders. Automatic segmentation of newborn MRI is a challenging
	task mainly due to the low intensity contrast and the growth process
	of the white matter tissue. Newborn white matter tissue undergoes
	a rapid myelination process, where the nerves are covered in myelin
	sheathes. It is necessary to identify the white matter tissue as
	myelinated or non-myelinated regions. The degree of myelination is
	a fractional voxel property that represents regional changes of white
	matter as a function of age. Our method makes use of a registered
	probabilistic brain atlas. The method first uses robust graph clustering
	and parameter estimation to find the initial intensity distributions.
	The distribution estimates are then used together with the spatial
	priors to perform bias correction. Finally, the method refines the
	segmentation using training sample pruning and non-parametric kernel
	density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the method is able
	to segment the brain tissue and identify myelinated and non-myelinated

	also mixtures, called mixclasses. A statistical model of the mixtures
	is proposed and studied by means of simulations. It is shown that
	it can be approximated by a Gaussian function under some conditions.
	The D'Agostino-Pearson normality test is used to assess the risk
	alpha of the approximation. In order to classify a brain into three
	types of brain tissue and deal with the problem of partial volume
	effects, the proposed algorithm uses two steps: 1) segmentation of
	the brain into pure and mixclasses using the mixture model; 2) reclassification
	of the mixclasses into the pure classes using knowledge about the
	obtained pure classes. Both steps use Markov random field (MRF) models.
	The multifractal dimension, describing the topology of the brain,
	is added to the MRFs to improve discrimination of the mixclasses.
	The algorithm is evaluated using both simulated images and real MR
	images with different T1-weighted acquisition sequences.},

	the two procedures cooperate to gradually and conjointly improve

	data from manually delineated MRI data. A total of 56 structures
	were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling
	was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this
	project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained
	on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for
	concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability
	standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34
	brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates
	using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al.,
	1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's
	FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
	version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation
	method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical
	brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants
	of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples
	of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For
	each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations
	were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We
	next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability
	of that voxel belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version
	of the atlas contains, for every voxel, probability densities for
	each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic
	labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces;
	we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps
	based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will
	serve as a resource for diverse applications including meta-analysis

  abstract = {In the study of early brain development, tissue segmentation of neonatal
	brain MR images remains challenging because of the insufficient image
	quality due to the properties of developing tissues. Among various
	brain tissue segmentation algorithms, atlas-based brain image segmentation
	can potentially achieve good segmentation results on neonatal brain
	images. However, their performances rely on both the quality of the
	atlas and the spatial correspondence between the atlas and the to-be-segmented
	image. Moreover, it is difficult to build a population atlas for
	neonates due to the requirement of a large set of tissue-segmented
	neonatal brain images. To combat these obstacles, we present a longitudinal
	neonatal brain image segmentation framework by taking advantage of
	the longitudinal data acquired at late time-point to build a subject-specific
	tissue probabilistic atlas. Specifically, tissue segmentation of
	the neonatal brain is formulated as two iterative steps of bias correction
	and probabilistic-atlas-based tissue segmentation, along with the
	longitudinal atlas reconstructed by the late time image of the same
	subject. The proposed method has been evaluated qualitatively through
	visual inspection and quantitatively by comparing with manual delineations
	and two population-atlas-based segmentation methods. Experimental
	results show that the utilization of a subject-specific probabilistic
	atlas can substantially improve tissue segmentation of neonatal brain
	images.},

	cortical segmentation techniques from brain magnetic resonance imaging
	based on three main classes: region-based, boundary/surface-based
	and fusion of boundary/surface-based with region-based techniques.
	In the first class, region-based techniques, we demonstrated more
	than 18 different techniques for segmenting the cerebral cortex from
	brain slices acquired in orthogonal directions. In the second class,
	boundary/surface-based, we showed more than ten different techniques
	to segment the cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance brain volumes.
	Particular emphasis will be placed by presenting four state-of-the-art
	systems in the third class, based on the fusion of boundary/surface-based
	with region-based techniques outlined in Part II of the paper, also
	called regional-geometric deformation models, which take the paradigm
	of partial differential equations in the level set framework. We
	also discuss the pros and cons of various techniques, besides giving
	the mathematical foundations for each sub-class in the cortical taxonomy.},

	An important question is therefore how the sensitivity of cortical

	The effect of adjusting for variability in WM/GM contrast on age
	sensitivity of cortical thickness was tested in 1189 healthy subjects
	from six different samples, enabling evaluation of consistency of
	effects within and between sites and scanners. Further, the influence
	of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis on cortical thickness with
	and without correction for contrast was tested in an additional sample
	of 96 patients. In healthy controls, regional increases in the sensitivity
	of the cortical thickness measure to age were found after correcting
	for contrast. Across samples, the strongest effects were observed
	in frontal, lateral temporal and parietal areas. Controlling for
	contrast variability also increased the cortical thickness estimates'
	sensitivity to AD, thus replicating the finding in an independent
	clinical sample. The results showed increased sensitivity of cortical
	estimates to AD in areas earlier reported to be compromised in AD,
	including medial temporal, inferior and superior parietal regions.
	In sum, the findings indicate that adjusting for contrast can increase

  abstract = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level
	set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have
	been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite
	the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of
	clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using
	slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological
	advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application
	called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation
	easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with
	little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods
	and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides
	the results of validation experiments performed in the context of
	an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes
	SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics
	for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable
	and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for
	lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided partial volume effect correction
	(PVC) in brain positron emission tomography (PET) is now a well-established
	approach to compensate the large bias in the estimate of regional
	radioactivity concentration, especially for small structures. The
	accuracy of the algorithms developed so far is, however, largely
	dependent on the performance of segmentation methods partitioning
	MRI brain data into its main classes, namely gray matter (GM), white
	matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A comparative evaluation
	of three brain MRI segmentation algorithms using simulated and clinical
	brain MR data was performed, and subsequently their impact on PVC
	in 18F-FDG and 18F-DOPA brain PET imaging was assessed. Two algorithms,
	the first is bundled in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2)
	package while the other is the Expectation Maximization Segmentation
	(EMS) algorithm, incorporate a priori probability images derived
	from MR images of a large number of subjects. The third, here referred
	to as the HBSA algorithm, is a histogram-based segmentation algorithm
	incorporating an Expectation Maximization approach to model a four-Gaussian
	mixture for both global and local histograms. Simulated under different
	combinations of noise and intensity non-uniformity, MR brain phantoms
	with known true volumes for the different brain classes were generated.
	The algorithms' performance was checked by calculating the kappa
	index assessing similarities with the "ground truth" as well as multiclass
	type I and type II errors including misclassification rates. The
	impact of image segmentation algorithms on PVC was then quantified
	using clinical data. The segmented tissues of patients' brain MRI
	were given as input to the region of interest (RoI)-based geometric
	transfer matrix (GTM) PVC algorithm, and quantitative comparisons
	were made. The results of digital MRI phantom studies suggest that
	the use of HBSA produces the best performance for WM classification.
	For GM classification, it is suggested to use the EMS. Segmentation
	performed on clinical MRI data show quite substantial differences,
	especially when lesions are present. For the particular case of PVC,
	SPM2 and EMS algorithms show very similar results and may be used
	interchangeably. The use of HBSA is not recommended for PVC. The
	partial volume corrected activities in some regions of the brain
	show quite large relative differences when performing paired analysis
	on 2 algorithms, implying a careful choice of the segmentation algorithm
	for GTM-based PVC.},

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},
