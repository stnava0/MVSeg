  abstract = {BACKGROUND: RPE65 is an essential molecule in the retinoid-visual
	cycle, and RPE65 gene mutations cause the congenital human blindness
	known as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Somatic gene therapy delivered
	to the retina of blind dogs with an RPE65 mutation dramatically restores
	retinal physiology and has sparked international interest in human
	treatment trials for this incurable disease. An unanswered question
	is how the visual cortex responds after prolonged sensory deprivation
	from retinal dysfunction. We therefore studied the cortex of RPE65-mutant
	dogs before and after retinal gene therapy. Then, we inquired whether
	there is visual pathway integrity and responsivity in adult humans
	with LCA due to RPE65 mutations (RPE65-LCA). METHODS AND FINDINGS:
	RPE65-mutant dogs were studied with fMRI. Prior to therapy, retinal
	and subcortical responses to light were markedly diminished, and
	there were minimal cortical responses within the primary visual areas
	of the lateral gyrus (activation amplitude mean +/- standard deviation
	[SD] = 0.07\% +/- 0.06\% and volume = 1.3 +/- 0.6 cm(3)). Following
	therapy, retinal and subcortical response restoration was accompanied
	by increased amplitude (0.18\% +/- 0.06\%) and volume (8.2 +/- 0.8
	cm(3)) of activation within the lateral gyrus (p < 0.005 for both).
	Cortical recovery occurred rapidly (within a month of treatment)
	and was persistent (as long as 2.5 y after treatment). Recovery was
	present even when treatment was provided as late as 1-4 y of age.
	Human RPE65-LCA patients (ages 18-23 y) were studied with structural
	magnetic resonance imaging. Optic nerve diameter (3.2 +/- 0.5 mm)
	was within the normal range (3.2 +/- 0.3 mm), and occipital cortical
	white matter density as judged by voxel-based morphometry was slightly
	but significantly altered (1.3 SD below control average, p = 0.005).
	Functional magnetic resonance imaging in human RPE65-LCA patients
	revealed cortical responses with a markedly diminished activation
	volume (8.8 +/- 1.2 cm(3)) compared to controls (29.7 +/- 8.3 cm(3),
	p < 0.001) when stimulated with lower intensity light. Unexpectedly,
	cortical response volume (41.2 +/- 11.1 cm(3)) was comparable to
	normal (48.8 +/- 3.1 cm(3), p = 0.2) with higher intensity light
	stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Visual cortical responses dramatically
	improve after retinal gene therapy in the canine model of RPE65-LCA.
	Human RPE65-LCA patients have preserved visual pathway anatomy and
	detectable cortical activation despite limited visual experience.
	Taken together, the results support the potential for human visual
	benefit from retinal therapies currently being aimed at restoring
	vision to the congenitally blind with genetic retinal disease.},

	disease have not previously been precisely quantified. In the present
	study, 16 patients with a progressive form of non-fluent aphasia
	(PNFA) were asked to tell a story from a wordless children's picture
	book. Errors in production were classified as either phonemic, involving
	language-based deformations that nevertheless result in possible
	sequences of English speech segments; or phonetic, involving a motor
	planning deficit and resulting in non-English speech segments. The
	distribution of cortical atrophy as revealed by structural MRI scans
	was examined quantitatively in a subset of PNFA patients (N=7). The
	few errors made by healthy seniors were only phonemic in type. PNFA
	patients made more than four times as many errors as controls. This
	included both phonemic and phonetic errors, with a preponderance
	of errors (82\%) classified as phonemic. The majority of phonemic
	errors were substitutions that shared most distinctive features with
	the target phoneme. The systematic nature of these substitutions
	is not consistent with a motor planning deficit. Cortical atrophy
	was found in prefrontal regions bilaterally and peri-Sylvian regions
	of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the speech errors produced
	by PNFA patients are mainly errors at the phonemic level of language
	processing and are not caused by a motor planning impairment.},

  abstract = {We present a unified method, based on symmetric diffeomorphisms, for
	studying longitudinal neurodegeneration. Our method first uses symmetric
	diffeomorphic normalization to find a spatiotemporal parameterization
	of an individual's image time series. The second step involves mapping
	a representative image or set of images from the time series into
	an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined
	with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical
	tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images.
	Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray
	matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
	We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero)
	and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that
	estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization
	enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo
	significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We
	found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and
	temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant
	effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel
	results, significant at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction,
	are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach
	coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL)
	labels. This paper shows the statistical power of symmetric diffeomorphic
	normalization for performing deformation-based studies of longitudinal

  abstract = {This work provides a new technique for surface oriented volumetric
	image analysis. The method makes no assumptions about topology, instead
	constructing a local neighborhood from image information, such as
	a segmentation or edge map, to define a surface patch. Neighborhood
	constructions using extrinsic and intrinsic distances are given.
	This representation allows one to estimate differential properties
	directly from the image's Gauss map. We develop a novel technique
	for this purpose which estimates the shape operator and yields both
	principal directions and curvatures. Only first derivatives need
	be estimated, making the method numerically stable. We show the use
	of these measures for multi-scale classification of image structure
	by the mean and Gaussian curvatures. Finally, we propose to register
	image volumes by surface curvature. This is particularly useful when
	geometry is the only variable. To illustrate this, we register binary
	segmented data by surface curvature, both rigidly and non-rigidly.
	A novel variant of Demons registration, extensible for use with differentiable
	similarity metrics, is also applied for deformable curvature-driven
	registration of medical images.},

	averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration
	problem. This approach is effective when using the large deformation
	viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the
	elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm
	is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but
	with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group
	forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation
	allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward
	the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation
	atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined
	by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques
	in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small
	deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently
	inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a
	tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic
	atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean
	anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The

	imaging (DTI), and decreases in cortical thickness, measured by high
	resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal

	derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows
	us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical

	to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically
	matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD
	(n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging.
	SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration
	pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected
	p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical
	thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed
	parietal and temporal network (p<0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within
	SCCA identified regions-significant differences exist between FTD
	and AD cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these
	distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships
	with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. We conclude that SCCA is a
	potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied
	productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

	effects secondary to fetal hypoxemia, or altered cerebrovascular

	Our results indicate that the caudate is significantly larger in

	detriments to the dopaminergic system. The right (P < 0.025) and

  abstract = {A multivariate classification approach has been presented to examine
	the brain abnormalities, i.e., due to prenatal cocaine exposure,
	using both structural and functional brain images. First, a regional
	statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative
	features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations
	of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features
	used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to
	registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature
	extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection
	method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification
	of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been
	applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal
	cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance
	was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally
	cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation.
	Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as
	well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional
	images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group
	difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent
	with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method.
	Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate
	classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also
	an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images.},

	known as "scripts" (e.g., "going fishing"). We assessed whether events
	in a script are processed in a linear-sequential manner or clustered-hierarchical
	manner, and we evaluated the neural basis for this processing capacity.
	Converging evidence was obtained from functional neuroimaging in
	healthy young adults and from behavioral and structural magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) data in patients with focal neurodegenerative
	disease. In both studies, participants judged the order of consecutive
	event pairs taken from a script. Event pairs either were clustered
	together within a script or were from different clusters within the
	script. Controls judged events more accurately and quickly if taken
	from the same cluster within a script compared with different clusters,
	even though all event pairs were consecutive, consistent with the
	hierarchical organization of a script. Functional magnetic resonance
	imaging associated this with bilateral inferior frontal activation.
	Patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia or behavior-variant frontotemporal
	dementia did not distinguish between event pairs from the same cluster
	or from different clusters within a script. Structural MRI associated
	this deficit with significant frontal cortical atrophy. Our findings
	suggest that frontal cortex contributes to clustering events during
	script comprehension, underlining the role of frontal cortex in the

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term
	disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published

	16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We

	1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal
	average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration;
	and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface
	labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison

	disorders in an unbiased group analysis. RESULTS: The greatest stressors
	for caregivers were apathy and disinhibition (p < 0.005 for both
	contrasts). Partially distinct areas of cortical atrophy were associated
	with these behaviors in both individual patients with these symptoms
	and group-wide analyses, including the dorsal anterior cingulate

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Animal studies have clearly demonstrated the effects of
	in utero cocaine exposure on neural ontogeny, especially in dopamine-rich
	areas of cerebral cortex; however, less is known about how in utero
	cocaine exposure affects longitudinal neurocognitive development
	of the human brain. We used continuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion
	functional MRI to measure the effect of in utero cocaine exposure
	on resting brain function by comparing resting cerebral blood flow
	of cocaine-exposed adolescents with non-cocaine-exposed control subjects.
	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four cocaine-exposed adolescents and
	25 matched non-cocaine-exposed control subjects underwent structural
	and perfusion functional MRI during resting states. Direct subtraction,
	voxel-wise general linear modeling, and region-of-interest analyses
	were performed on the cerebral blood flow images to compare the resting
	cerebral blood flow between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with
	control subjects, cocaine-exposed adolescents showed significantly
	reduced global cerebral blood flow. The decrease of cerebral blood
	flow in cocaine-exposed adolescents was observed mainly in posterior
	and inferior brain regions, including the occipital cortex and thalamus.
	After adjusting for global cerebral blood flow, however, a significant
	increase in relative cerebral blood flow in cocaine-exposed adolescents
	was found in anterior and superior brain regions, including the prefrontal,
	cingulate, insular, amygdala, and superior parietal cortex. Furthermore,
	the functional modulations by in utero cocaine exposure on all of
	these regions except amygdala cannot be accounted for by the variation
	in brain anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: In utero cocaine exposure may reduce
	global cerebral blood flow, and this reduction may persist into adolescence.
	The relative increase of cerebral blood flow in anterior and superior
	brain regions in cocaine-exposed adolescent participants suggests
	that compensatory mechanisms for reduced global cerebral blood flow
	may develop during neural ontogeny. Arterial spin-labeling perfusion
	MRI may be a valuable tool for investigating the long-term effects
	of in utero drug exposure.},

	We demonstrate a powerful method of comparing complex shapes in 3-dimensions

	91.0\% of the voxels in the four latex/plaster VEs are within 2 mm
	of their corresponding cranial VEs surfaces. The average error is
	relatively small, and variation in the pattern of error across the

	overestimated in both human and chimpanzee specimens, and the area
	overlaying Broca's area in humans was somewhat underestimated. This

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is one
	of the most common genetic causes of cognitive impairment and developmental
	disability yet little is known about the neural bases of those challenges.
	Here we expand upon our previous neurocognitive studies by specifically
	investigating the hypothesis that changes in neural connectivity
	relate to cognitive impairment in children with the disorder. METHODS:
	Whole brain analyses of multiple measures computed from diffusion
	tensor image data acquired from the brains of children with the disorder
	and typically developing controls. We also correlated diffusion tensor
	data with performance on a visuospatial cognitive task that taps
	spatial attention. RESULTS: Analyses revealed four common clusters,
	in the parietal and frontal lobes, that showed complementary patterns
	of connectivity in children with the deletion and typical controls.
	We interpreted these results as indicating differences in connective
	complexity to adjoining cortical regions that are critical to the
	cognitive functions in which affected children show impairments.
	Strong, and similarly opposing patterns of correlations between diffusion
	values in those clusters and spatial attention performance measures
	considerably strengthened that interpretation. CONCLUSION: Our results
	suggest that atypical development of connective patterns in the brains
	of children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome indicate a
	neuropathology that is related to the visuospatial cognitive impairments
	that are commonly found in affected individuals.},

	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This

	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating

	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
