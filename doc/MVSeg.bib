  abstract = {We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter
	structures from diffusion tensor images. Our approach is grounded
	on the theoretically well-founded differential geometrical properties
	of the space of multivariate normal distributions. We introduce a
	variational formulation, in the level set framework, to estimate
	the optimal segmentation according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion
	tensors exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions.
	Moreover, we must respect the geometric constraints imposed by the
	interfaces existing among the cerebral structures and detected by
	the gradient of the diffusion tensor image. We validate our algorithm
	on synthetic data and report interesting results on real datasets.
	We focus on two structures of the white matter with different properties
	and respectively known as the corpus callosum and the corticospinal
	tract.},

  abstract = {The problem of automatic quantification of brain tissue by utilizing
	single-valued (single echo) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
	scans is addressed. It is shown that this problem can be solved without
	classification or segmentation, a method that may be particularly
	useful in quantifying white matter lesions where the range of values
	associated with the lesions and the white matter may heavily overlap.
	The general technique utilizes a statistical model of the noise and
	partial volume effect together with a finite mixture density description
	of the tissues. The quantification is then formulated as a minimization
	problem of high order with up to six separate densities as part of
	the mixture. This problem is solved by tree annealing with and without
	partial volume utilized, the results compared, and the sensitivity
	of the tree annealing algorithm to various parameters is exhibited.
	The actual quantification is performed by two methods: a classification-based
	method called Bayes quantification, and parameter estimation. Results
	from each method are presented for synthetic and actual data.},

  abstract = {We describe a sequence of low-level operations to isolate and classify
	brain tissue within T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI).
	Our method first removes nonbrain tissue using a combination of anisotropic
	diffusion filtering, edge detection, and mathematical morphology.
	We compensate for image nonuniformities due to magnetic field inhomogeneities
	by fitting a tricubic B-spline gain field to local estimates of the
	image nonuniformity spaced throughout the MRI volume. The local estimates
	are computed by fitting a partial volume tissue measurement model
	to histograms of neighborhoods about each estimate point. The measurement
	model uses mean tissue intensity and noise variance values computed
	from the global image and a multiplicative bias parameter that is
	estimated for each region during the histogram fit. Voxels in the
	intensity-normalized image are then classified into six tissue types
	using a maximum a posteriori classifier. This classifier combines
	the partial volume tissue measurement model with a Gibbs prior that
	models the spatial properties of the brain. We validate each stage
	of our algorithm on real and phantom data. Using data from the 20
	normal MRI brain data sets of the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository,
	our method achieved average kappa indices of kappa = 0.746 +/- 0.114
	for gray matter (GM) and kappa = 0.798 +/- 0.089 for white matter
	(WM) compared to expert labeled data. Our method achieved average
	kappa indices kappa = 0.893 +/- 0.041 for GM and kappa = 0.928 +/-
	0.039 for WM compared to the ground truth labeling on 12 volumes
	from the Montreal Neurological Institute's BrainWeb phantom.},
